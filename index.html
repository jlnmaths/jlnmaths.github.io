					<div> The Role of Heterogeneity in Coopetition in Profession Road Cycling (with David Piazolo) (<a href='cycling.pdf'>Slides</a>) <br>
						<b>Abstract: </b>
						    Road cycling races, although won by individual riders, are a competition of teams. Riding behind other riders significantly reduces the effort required to hold a given speed. These races thus naturally feature the formation of groups of riders on the road. We propose a model capturing the dynamics of the simultaneous competition between and cooperation within such groups of riders with team affiliations. Our model suggests that heterogeneity in rider strength or team strength within a group is favorable for between-group competition. If only the strongest rider of each team competes for the win, adding teammates to this rider's group is sometimes undesirable for the team, but adding teammates to competing groups is always helpful. We confirm our theoretical predictions with results data from more than 40 seasons of professional road cycling races and indicate further empirical avenues we aim to take.

					<div> Preferences for Narratives (with Katharina Momsen) (<a href='narratives.pdf'>pdf</a>) <br>
						<b>Abstract: </b>
						We conduct an experiment to investigate the way people interact with tables of data if certain patterns in the data are pointed out by narratives with different characteristics. We vary the anticipatory utility and complexity of narratives, holding data constant and compare deterministic to stochastic narratives.

					<div> Finding Large Rainbow Trees in Colorings of <img class="img-down" src='knn.svg'> (<b><i>The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics</i>, Volume 30, Issue 4 2023</b>). (<a href='https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v30i4p28'>Link to Journal Page.</a>) <br>
					<b>Abstract: </b>
					A subgraph of an edge-coloured graph is called rainbow if all of its edges have distinct colours. An edge-colouring is called locally k-bounded if each vertex is incident with at most k edges of the same colour. Recently, Montgomery, Pokrovskiy and Sudakov showed that for large n, a certain locally 2-bounded edge-colouring of the complete graph K{2n+1} contains a rainbow copy of any tree with n edges, thereby resolving a long-standing conjecture by Ringel: For large n, K_{2n+1} can be decomposed into copies of any tree with n edges. In this paper, we employ their methods to show that any locally k-bounded edge-colouring of the complete bipartite graph K_{n,n} contains a rainbow copy of any tree with (1-o(1))n/k edges. We show that this implies that every tree with n edges packs at least n times into K_{n+o(1), n+o(1)}. We conjecture that for large n, K_{n,n} can be decomposed into n  copies of any tree with n edges.
