					<div class="paper"> <b>Don't Put All Your Legs in One Basket - Theory and Evidence on Coopetition in Road Cycling </b> (with David Piazolo) (<a href='Cycling_Coopetition.pdf'>Paper</a>) <br>
						Abstract: 
    						Road cycling races, although won by individual riders, are a competition of teams. Riding behind other riders significantly reduces the energy required to hold a given speed. These races thus provide free-riding incentives. We introduce a game-theoretic framework of this strategic setup to analyze a team's winning probability in various race situations and to examine group characteristics facilitating coordination. We complement our theoretical results with an empirical analysis using data from more than 40 seasons of professional road cycling races. Our model suggests that asymmetry in rider strength or team strength within a group is favorable for group coordination. Also, adding teammates to competing groups is beneficial because it leads to strategic benefits, increasing the free-riding opportunities in both groups. We find empirical evidence that a teammate in a group behind has a positive impact on win probability, indicating that such an effect indeed exists.					</div>
					<div class = "paper"> <b>On the Demand for Mental Models </b> (with Katharina Momsen) (<a href='Mental_Models_Experiment.pdf'>Slides</a>) <br>
						Abstract: 
						We investigate how decision-makers' inference from historical data is influenced by decision-support in the form of hints that point out patterns in historical data. We also investigate decision-makers' attitudes toward such decision-support by letting them choose between observing a larger dataset to infer from or receiving a hint. In addition, we ask if decision-makers are prone to wishful thinking and whether they exhibit a preference for simpler or more complex patterns referred to by the hints. In a series of online experiments, participants face a prediction task while being exposed to two types of information: historical outcomes and hints about patterns in the historical dataset. Participants repeat the prediction task with the option to choose between additional data points and an additional hint. We find that hints move assessments strongly and that the majority of subjects prefers ``soft'' hints over ``hard'' historical data. We find no evidence that agents prefer simple models (in the sense of using Occam's razor) or those that induce higher anticipatory utility.					</div>
